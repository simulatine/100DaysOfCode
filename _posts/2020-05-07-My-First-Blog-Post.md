# 100 Days of Code

May 2020. Along with most of the world, I'm stuck in lockdown.
I've decided to use this time to learn some new skills.

I have being used Python for 15 years, but always as a hobby,
and not very well.

I've now decided to improve my skills by taking on the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

I aim to code for one hour each day, and publicly posting my progress.
I will tweet a short summary on my [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/simulatine)
and post a longer blog post here.

I will also post my code to my [100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/simulatine/100DaysOfCode) repository on GitHub:
