## ## Mobile Python Graphics ## ##
One of my goals is to be able to code on the go ... once lockdown ends



For many years I had [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) on my iPhone. This is a full implementation of Python, and is a very powerful tool, but its graphics capabilities are limited to customized [Scene](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/docs/ios/scene.html) and [UI](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/docs/ios/ui.html) modules. It doesn't support any desktop graphics library, which meant that any graphical programs I developed on my desktop simply would not run on the iPhone.

I recently discovered that the Tkinter and Pygame run on Android devices, with [Pydroid3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3&hl=en_GB). This has [Pygame_SDL2](https://pygame-sdl2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) built-in - a version of Pygame that is almost entirely compatible with the standard desktop version of Pygame.

I didn't own any Android devices, so decided to invest as cheaply as possible.
