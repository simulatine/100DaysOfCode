## Test ##
I was able to display this easily enough from a [standard page](https://simulatine.github.io/100DaysOfCode/showimage.html "Show Image") in the root of my website with a Markdown image link:

```
![Screenshot](assets/100DaysOfCode.png "Screenshot")
```

But the same link wasn't displaying properly in my blog post:

![Python code screenshot](assets/100DaysOfCode.png "Python code screenshot")

OK, so blog post files are in a different folder `_posts`.  Maybe I need to use a rooted path:

```
![Screenshot](/assets/100DaysOfCode.png "Screenshot")
```

which displayed

![Screenshot](/assets/100DaysOfCode.png "Screenshot")

Hmm, this didn't work either - it seems that the `/assets` directory that GitHub sees is not the same as the one I created. Neither did assuming the website root was one level up, at the root of the entire repository:

```
![Screenshot](/docs/assets/100DaysOfCode.png "Screenshot")
```

I get the same broken image link:

![Screenshot](/docs/assets/100DaysOfCode.png "Screenshot")

## Solved! ##
After some investigation, I paid attention to the blog post URL in my brower's address bar, and realised my post is buried three levels down in a virtual folder hierarchy, with the year, month and date all represented by folders:

https://simulatine.github.io/100DaysOfCode/2020/05/08/Struggling-With-GitHub-Pages.html

Aha! Maybe a relative path would work. I would need to go three levels up from my post's URL to get back to the root of the website, so would need `../` three times:

```
![Screenshot](../../../../assets/100DaysOfCode.png "Screenshot")
```

Success! I can finally see an image:

![Screenshot](../../../../assets/100DaysOfCode.png "Screenshot")
