Welcome
-------

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code web page. This site will show my progress with the challenge. I plan to:

- Code one hour every day for the next 100 days
- Keep myself publicly accountable by tweeting my daily progress with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
- Connecting with the community by linking my Twitter progress updates to my GitHub repository
- Keep a daily log of progress by posting on this page.

Project Goals
-------------

My goals are to:

- Improve my Python coding skills
- Learn more about Python graphics
- Learn about using Pygame to create cross-platform graphics
- Create interesting programs, with a focus on simulations and cellular automata

I plan to use Python3 on my Windows 10 laptop and Pydroid3 on my Android tablet, and will aim to create cross platform code.
