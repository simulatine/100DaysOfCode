Focus on Programming
====================

I spent the first several days of this challenge working more on configuring
a blog site than on actual coding. I started with the default Jekyll tool
provided by GitHub Pages, but quickly moved on to the Python based
[Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) static site generator.

I think I am done now - I am happy with my blog configuration, and I've got a
foundation to document my future progress with #100DaysOfCode.

So let's get back to coding.
