A New Challenge
===============

Along with most of the world, I've been stuck in lockdown for weeks, with no end in sight.
So I've decided to use this time to learn some new skills.

I have used Python on and off for 15 years, but always as a hobby,
and I do not consider myself particularly proficient.
I've now decided to improve my skills by taking on the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

I aim to code for one hour each day, and publicly posting my progress.
I will tweet a short summary on my [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/simulatine)
and post a longer blog post here.

I will also post my code snippets to my [100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/simulatine/100DaysOfCode) repository on GitHub.

I spent my time today learning about GitHub, getting a repository configured, and creating
this web page.
