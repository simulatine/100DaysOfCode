  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I spent my time today learning about GitHub Pages, and trying to get an image to display in my blog post. I am using the default <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll">Jekyll</a> site generator tool with the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">Minima</a> theme, with my website contents in the <code>docs</code> folder in the master branch of my repository. I create a subfolder <code>doc/images</code> on my local drive, and added a simple screenshot <code>image1.png</code>. After committing this change, and syncing with GitHub, I confirmed that the folder and file were present in my repository. So far, so good.</p>
<p><em>10 May 2020:</em> Since writing this post, I subsequently changed the tool I use to create these posts from Jekyll to a Python based site generator tool called Pelican, so the links below may display differently than they did before.</p>
<h2>Broken Images</h2>
<p>I was able to display this easily enough from a <a href="https://simulatine.github.io/100DaysOfCode/showimage.html" title="Show Image">standard page</a> in the root of my website with a Markdown image link:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">!</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">Screenshot</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">images</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">image1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">png</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&quot;Screenshot&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>But the same link wasn't displaying properly in my blog post:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="./images/image1.png" title="Screenshot"></p>
<p>OK, so blog post files are in a different folder <code>_posts</code>.  Maybe I need to use a rooted path:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">!</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">Screenshot</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">images</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">image1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">png</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&quot;Screenshot&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>which displayed</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="/images/image1.png" title="Screenshot"></p>
<p>Hmm, this didn't work either - it seems that the <code>/images</code> directory that GitHub sees is not the same as the one I created. Neither did assuming the website root was one level up, at the root of the entire repository:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">!</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">Screenshot</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">docs</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">images</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">image1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">png</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&quot;Screenshot&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>I get the same broken image link:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="/docs/images/image1.png" title="Screenshot"></p>
<h2>Solved!</h2>
<p>After some investigation, I paid attention to the blog post URL in my brower's address bar, and realised my post is buried three levels down in a virtual folder hierarchy, with the year, month and date all represented by folders:</p>
<p>https://simulatine.github.io/100DaysOfCode/2020/05/08/Struggling-With-GitHub-Pages.html</p>
<p>Aha! Maybe a relative path would work. I would need to go three levels up from my post's URL to get back to the root of the website, so would need <code>../</code> three times:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">!</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">Screenshot</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">(..</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="p">..</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="p">..</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">images</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">image1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">png</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">&quot;Screenshot&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Success! I can finally see an image:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="https://simulatine.github.io/100DaysOfCode/images/image1.png" title="Screenshot"></p>
