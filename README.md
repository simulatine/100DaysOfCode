# 100DaysOfCode
My daily coding progress for the next 100 days

*May 2020*

Project Goals
=============

My goals are to:

- Improve my Python coding skills
- Learn more about Python graphics
- Learn about using Pygame to create cross-platform graphics
- Create interesting programs, with a focus on simulations and cellular automata

I plan to use Python3 on my Windows 10 laptop and Pydroid3 on my Android tablet, and will focus
on creating cross platform code.

This project was inspired by https://100DaysOfCode.com
