<p>I have a growing library of more than 350 digital ebooks. Today I started
to write some Python code to help me track and search my ebook library.</p>
<p><em>A short aside on nomenclature: ebook, e-book, eBook or e-Book? It seems there
is no standard term to describe a digital book. In this article I will use the
simplest form </em>ebook<em>, which is similar to email.</em></p>
<h2>Calibre</h2>
<p><img alt="Calibre" src="https://simulatine.github.io/100DaysOfCode/images/2020-05-12_Calibre_eBook_Screenshot.jpg"></p>
<p><a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> is a powerful open source ebook
manager. It provides the ability to read, stoire and convert ebooks in many
formats.</p>
<p>I had most of my ebooks in Calibre, but was missing a few which were scattered
elsewhere on my laptop's hard disk. I also wanted to check my Calibre library
against my Amazon purchase history, but didn't want to do this manually.</p>
<p>I help me achieve this, I wrote a Python function to extract the details of my
Calibre library allowing me to easily manipulate and search the data.</p>
<h2>Calibre and Python</h2>
<p>Interestingly, Calibre is developed in Python, and actually includes an entire
embedded copy of the Python interpreter. To access the Calibre library, I
had to call my program with 
<a href="https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/calibre-debug.html">Calibre in debug mode</a>
rather than directly with Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>calibre-debug &lt;python-script&gt;
</code></pre></div>


<p>The embedded interpreter had access to the standard Python libraries, but not
to any other modules I had installed wih <code>pip</code>. This meant that my program
was limited to using standard Python library functions.</p>
<p>A further complexity was that the Python interpreter embedded in Calibre,
at least as of Calibre version 4.15 in May 2020, is the older Python 2,
specifically Python 2.7.16.</p>
<p>This meant I couldn't use any Python 3 code, which clashes with most of my
other Python programs, which I write in the latest version, currently Python
3.8.3.
(I actually discovered this when trying to use the Pathlib module to
manage the path to my Calibre library - Pathlib is Python 3 only!)</p>
<p>For these two reasons, I decided to create a standalone program to extract
the Calibre library and save it to disk. I will leave the searching and
comparison with Amazon to a separate Python 3 program.</p>
<h2>Writing the code</h2>
<p>First, I imported the Calibre API <code>calibre.library</code> and also the Python pretty
printer module <code>pprint</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>import calibre.library
import pprint
</code></pre></div>


<p>Next, I created a function <code>get_calibre_books()</code> to open the Calibre library
and get the data:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>def get_calibre_books():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Get the list of books and authors from my Calibre eBook library.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    # First open the Calibre library and get a list of the book IDs
    calibre_db = calibre.library.db(
        ebooksconf.CALIBRE_LIBRARY_LOCATION
    ).new_api
    book_ids = calibre_db.all_book_ids()
    print(&quot;Got {} book IDs from Calibre library&quot;.format(len(book_ids)))
</code></pre></div>


<p>Calibre returns its data with a unique numeric ID for each ebook. I wanted to
compare the Calibre data with a list of ebooks from Amazon, so needed a
different key common to both data sources. I decided to use the ebook title as
the unique key. This could cause some issues if I had two ebooks with <em>exactly</em>
the same title, but so far that hasn't been a problem for me.</p>
<p>So I created a new dictionary, to store the data in the format I want, with the
dictionary key set to the book title. I displayed an error if I found two books
with exactly the same title.</p>
<p><em>Note: as an exercise for the future, I could improve the error handling here
using try/except, and using the Python <code>logging</code> module to improve the error
logging.</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>    books = {}
    for book in book_ids:
        title = calibre_db.field_for(&quot;title&quot;, book)
        if title in books:
            print(&quot;ERROR: Duplicate book found for title {}&quot;.format(title))
</code></pre></div>


<p>My dictionary values were the ebook author, or to be precise, authors. As some
ebooks have more than one author, Calibre returns a list rather than a single
string. The list could potentially have had zero elements if I didn't have any
author listed for the ebook in Calibre, but in practice that has not been the
case for my library.</p>
<p>For the moment, I am not interested in the many other fields in the Calibre
library. If I wanted, I could have extracted the ebook format, cover picture,
publisher, date etc. I can get a full list of fields for a book with the
following code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>metadata = calibre_db.get_metadata(book_id)
print(metadata.standard_field_keys())
</code></pre></div>


<p>The <a href="https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/develop.html#api-documentation-for-various-parts-of-calibre">Calibre API documentation</a>
has a lot more details.</p>
<p>After adding the authors data as a dictionary value, I completed the function
by returning the entire <code>books</code> dictionary to the caller.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>    books = {}
    for book in book_ids:
        title = calibre_db.field_for(&quot;title&quot;, book)
        if title in books:
            print(&quot;ERROR: Duplicate book found for title {}&quot;.format(title))
        else:
            # The authors field contains a list of zero or more author names
            authors = calibre_db.field_for(&quot;authors&quot;, book)
            books[title] = authors
    return books
</code></pre></div>


<p>I can now create the main part of my script, calling my get_calibre_books()
function, and displaying the results with pprint.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    calibre_books = get_calibre_books()
    pprint.pprint(calibre_books)
</code></pre></div>


<h2>Exporting the data</h2>
<p>Now that I have the data in a Python dictionary, I want to save it to disk
so I can access it from other Python 3 scripts. There are several ways to do
this. Python has a built in <code>pickle</code> module that saves any Python object to a
file. I could also simply write my dictionary contents in plain text to a text
file. I decided to save to a JSON file format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>print(&quot;Writing {} books to JSON&quot;.format(len(calibre_books)))
with open(ebooksconf.JSON_FILE, &quot;w&quot;) as output:
    json.dump(calibre_books, output)
</code></pre></div>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I now have a short script that extracts my Calibre library contents and saves
it to a JSON file. In a later blog post, I will show I can use this data
to search and compare with other sources. The full source code is in my
Github repository here:</p>
<p>https://github.com/simulatine/100DaysOfCode/blob/master/eBooks/get_calibre_library.py</p>
<p>Creating this script taught me about the Calibre API, how to restructure
data with a Python dictionary, and how to save data with JSON.</p>
