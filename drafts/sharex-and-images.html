<p>Today I learned about <a href="https://getsharex.com/">ShareX</a>. I installed ShareX
some time ago, but never really bothered to explore its feature and configure
it in more detail.</p>
<p>ShareX's power lies in its customizable workflow. It not only takes
screenshots, it can then automatically edit, save and process them in a wide
variety of ways.</p>
<p>Lets look at what is possible.</p>
<h1>Configuring ShareX</h1>
<p><img alt="ShareX Main Screen" src="https://simulatine.github.io/100DaysOfCode/images/ShareX_Main_Screen.png"></p>
<p>ShareX allows you to configure a screen capture workflow, using tasks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture: capture the full screen, a window, or a small region. You can also
take video recordings of screen activity and even use OCR to capture text.</li>
<li>After capture tasks: add a watermark or image effects to the captured image,
edit it, print it or save it to the clipboard for pasting it directly into a
document.</li>
<li>Upload: upload the image to a wide variety of websites such as Dropbox,
Twitter and Imgur.</li>
<li>After upload tasks: The most useful task in this section is the ability to
copy the image URL to the clipboard, so you can paste it into an online post or
a web site update.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default configuration of each task can be configured in the Task Settings
menu.</p>
<p>You can configure multiple workflows, each with a different combination of
tasks. Each workflow can be easily triggered with a Hotkey.</p>
<p>Lets create a Workflow. For this example, I will modify the existing
"Capture Region" workflow.</p>
<h3>Default Settings</h3>
<p>Lets first change some application wide defaults. These will modify all
workflows.</p>
<h3>Screenshots folder</h3>
<p>ShareX normally saves data to a <code>ShareX</code> folder under Documents. I don't mind
it saving log files and workflow settings to that location, but I would prefer
screenshots to be saved to Pictures, specifically to the <code>Pictures\Screenshots</code>
folder used by Windows itself. That makes screenshot images easier to find.</p>
<p>I configured this by going to Application settings and then to the Paths tab.
I enabled the "Use custom screenshots folder" checkbox and entered my Picture
folder:
C:\Users\Simulatine\Pictures\Screenshots</p>
<p>ScreenX also creates subfolders for each year and month. I disabled this, so
that all screenshots are saved to the same folder, by removing the <code>%y-%mo</code>
pattern from the Sub folder pattern box.</p>
<p><img alt="ShareX App Settings" src="https://simulatine.github.io/100DaysOfCode/images/ShareX_App_Settings_Paths_Dialog.png"></p>
<h3>Filenames</h3>
<p>I also changed the default filename pattern. ScreenX saves the screenshot with
a random 10 character filename. I didn't want this! Instead, I wanted the
default filename to reflect the current date and time. I can always override
this default in individual workflows by enabling the Save image to file as
task, which will allow me to specify the filename after each capture.</p>
<p>To configure the filename, I went to Task Settings, and then to the Upload\File
naming tab. </p>
<p>In the "Name pattern for capture or clipboard upload, I entered
%y-%mo-%d_%h.%mi.%s. This ensured that screenshots are saved with a filename
using the current date and time, such as 2020-05-15_19.15.00.png.</p>
<p>Similarly, I changed the "Name pattern for window capture" to
%pn_%y-%mo-%d_%h.%mi.%s. When I capture a specific appliation window, the
application name is now included in the filename, for example
chrome_2020-05-15_19.15.00.png</p>
<p><img alt="ShareX Task Settings" src="https://simulatine.github.io/100DaysOfCode/images/ShareX_Task_Settings_File_Naming_Dialog.png"></p>
<h3>Drop Shadows</h3>
<p>I also decided to add a drop shadow effect to images. This makes them stand off
the screen.</p>
<p>I went to Task Settings, and then to the Image\Effects tab, and click on Image
effects configuration.</p>
<p>I clicked on Add, and from the Filter submenu, selected the Shadow effect. I
changed the size from 10 to 15 to increase the effect.</p>
<p>Finally, I ensured that this was the only enabled image effect and clicked on
Close.</p>

<h2>Configuring a Workflow</h2>
<p>I can now bring several of these settings together into a single workflow.</p>
<p>I went to Hotkey settings, where there were several pre-configured workflows.
I clicked the gear icon to the left of Capture Region to configure this
workflow.</p>
<p><img alt="ShareX Hotkey Settings" src="https://simulatine.github.io/100DaysOfCode/images/ShareX_Hotkey_Settings_Dialog.png"></p>
<p>I enabled Override after capture settings, and checked the following tasks:
Add image effects/watermark - this will add the drop shadow effect I configured
above.
Open in image editor - allowing me to annotate the image, add arrows or
highlight specific areas of interest.
Save image to file as - so that I can give the file a proper name and save it
to a target folder of my choice.
Copy file path to clipboard - ready for me to paste into my Markdown document.</p>
<p><img alt="ShareX Task Override Menu" src="https://simulatine.github.io/100DaysOfCode/images/ShareX_Task_Override_Menu.png"></p>
<p>I don't need to do any of the other tasks here.</p>
