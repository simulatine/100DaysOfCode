Project Goals
=============

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code page. This site will show my progress with the 100 Days of Code challenge. My goals are to:

- Improve my Python coding skills
- Learn more about Python graphics
- Learn about using Pygame to create cross-platform graphics
- Create interesting programs, with a focus on simulations and cellular automata

I plan to use Python3 on my Windows 10 laptop and Pydroid3 on my Android tablet, and will aim to create cross platform code.
